We have 2 proposals.
One is a dataset from kaggle, moderate entries(1000 rows),
many features(84), with clean easy to use data.
The other one is real data from one of our team member. Large dataset
(2 tables with thouands of rows), small amount of features(around 10), with
messy data which required cleaning and some data mining.
The 2 tables for this proposal is attached seperately with proposals.
